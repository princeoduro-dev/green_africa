Welcome to Green Africa: Planting Trees for a Sustainable Future


About Us
Green Roots is a non-profit organization dedicated to combating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability through tree planting initiatives. Our mission is to reforest and restore ecosystems, mitigate carbon emissions, and preserve biodiversity for future generations.

Our Mission
We transfer urban landscapes into thriving green havens. We work with local communities to plant trees and create green spaces that are healthy, safe, and beautiful. We also work with businesses and government agencies to promote sustainable practices and reduce carbon emissions.

Our Vision
 We envision a world where lush forests thrive, providing clean air, conserving water resources, and supporting diverse ecosystems. Through our efforts, we aim to create greener, healthier communities and a more sustainable planet.

What We Do
At Green Roots, we organize tree planting events in collaboration with local communities, schools, businesses, and government agencies. We carefully select native tree species that are well-suited to the local climate and ecosystem, ensuring long-term ecological benefits.

Our projects not only replenish tree cover but also engage volunteers in hands-on conservation activities, fostering environmental stewardship and community involvement. We provide educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the importance of trees and inspire environmental action.

Our Core Values
Collabration, Innovation, Education and Equity.
